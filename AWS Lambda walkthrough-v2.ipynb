I want to write a lambda function that grabs an existing zipped package directory from s3, recieves a python file from arguments or is pointed at another zip file containing a package tree, then zips everything together and puts the resulitng large zip file in another s3 bucket.  After that the regular create/update lambda function commadns can be run.  I expect this to be signficantly faster."
